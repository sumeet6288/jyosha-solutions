# THIS SECTION CONTAINS CRITICAL TESTING INSTRUCTIONS FOR BOTH AGENTS
# BOTH MAIN_AGENT AND TESTING_AGENT MUST PRESERVE THIS ENTIRE BLOCK

# Communication Protocol:
# If the `testing_agent` is available, main agent should delegate all testing tasks to it.
#
# You have access to a file called `test_result.md`. This file contains the complete testing state
# and history, and is the primary means of communication between main and the testing agent.
#
# Main and testing agents must follow this exact format to maintain testing data. 
# The testing data must be entered in yaml format Below is the data structure:
# 
## user_problem_statement: {problem_statement}
## backend:
##   - task: "Task name"
##     implemented: true
##     working: true  # or false or "NA"
##     file: "file_path.py"
##     stuck_count: 0
##     priority: "high"  # or "medium" or "low"
##     needs_retesting: false
##     status_history:
##         -working: true  # or false or "NA"
##         -agent: "main"  # or "testing" or "user"
##         -comment: "Detailed comment about status"
##
## frontend:
##   - task: "Task name"
##     implemented: true
##     working: true  # or false or "NA"
##     file: "file_path.js"
##     stuck_count: 0
##     priority: "high"  # or "medium" or "low"
##     needs_retesting: false
##     status_history:
##         -working: true  # or false or "NA"
##         -agent: "main"  # or "testing" or "user"
##         -comment: "Detailed comment about status"
##
## metadata:
##   created_by: "main_agent"
##   version: "1.0"
##   test_sequence: 0
##   run_ui: false
##
## test_plan:
##   current_focus:
##     - "Task name 1"
##     - "Task name 2"
##   stuck_tasks:
##     - "Task name with persistent issues"
##   test_all: false
##   test_priority: "high_first"  # or "sequential" or "stuck_first"
##
## agent_communication:
##     -agent: "main"  # or "testing" or "user"
##     -message: "Communication message between agents"

# Protocol Guidelines for Main agent
#
# 1. Update Test Result File Before Testing:
#    - Main agent must always update the `test_result.md` file before calling the testing agent
#    - Add implementation details to the status_history
#    - Set `needs_retesting` to true for tasks that need testing
#    - Update the `test_plan` section to guide testing priorities
#    - Add a message to `agent_communication` explaining what you've done
#
# 2. Incorporate User Feedback:
#    - When a user provides feedback that something is or isn't working, add this information to the relevant task's status_history
#    - Update the working status based on user feedback
#    - If a user reports an issue with a task that was marked as working, increment the stuck_count
#    - Whenever user reports issue in the app, if we have testing agent and task_result.md file so find the appropriate task for that and append in status_history of that task to contain the user concern and problem as well 
#
# 3. Track Stuck Tasks:
#    - Monitor which tasks have high stuck_count values or where you are fixing same issue again and again, analyze that when you read task_result.md
#    - For persistent issues, use websearch tool to find solutions
#    - Pay special attention to tasks in the stuck_tasks list
#    - When you fix an issue with a stuck task, don't reset the stuck_count until the testing agent confirms it's working
#
# 4. Provide Context to Testing Agent:
#    - When calling the testing agent, provide clear instructions about:
#      - Which tasks need testing (reference the test_plan)
#      - Any authentication details or configuration needed
#      - Specific test scenarios to focus on
#      - Any known issues or edge cases to verify
#
# 5. Call the testing agent with specific instructions referring to test_result.md
#
# IMPORTANT: Main agent must ALWAYS update test_result.md BEFORE calling the testing agent, as it relies on this file to understand what to test next.

# 🚀 AUTOMATIC SETUP FOR NEW EMERGENT ACCOUNT
# ============================================
# 
# When loading this repo in a different Emergent account or cloning to a new environment:
#
# AUTOMATIC DEPENDENCY INSTALLATION:
# The application uses automatic dependency installation via supervisor configuration.
# When the container starts, dependencies are automatically installed from:
#   - Backend: /app/backend/requirements.txt (includes emergentintegrations)
#   - Frontend: /app/frontend/package.json (via yarn)
#
# MANUAL INSTALLATION (if needed):
#   Backend:  cd /app/backend && pip install -r requirements.txt
#   Frontend: cd /app/frontend && yarn install
#   Restart:  sudo supervisorctl restart all
#
# ACCESS THE APPLICATION:
#   Frontend: http://localhost:3000 (or your preview URL)
#   Backend API Docs: http://localhost:8001/docs
#
# SETUP TIME: Approximately 2-3 minutes for full dependency installation
#
# TROUBLESHOOTING:
#   - Check service status: sudo supervisorctl status
#   - Backend logs: tail -50 /var/log/supervisor/backend.err.log
#   - Frontend logs: tail -50 /var/log/supervisor/frontend.out.log
#   - If dependencies fail to install, run manual installation commands above

Backend: Installed all dependencies from requirements.txt (47 packages including FastAPI, MongoDB drivers, emergentintegrations, AI libraries). Frontend: Installed all dependencies via yarn (944 packages). MongoDB: Running on localhost:27017 with database 'chatbase_db' properly configured. Application accessible at preview URL."
  - agent: "main"
    message: "✅ CUSTOM LIMITS & FEATURES FIX APPLIED (2025-11-14): Fixed critical issue where custom limits from admin panel were not reflecting on user dashboard. ROOT CAUSE: plan_service.py check_limit() and get_usage_stats() functions were only using plan limits, ignoring user's custom_limits field. FIXES: 1) Updated check_limit() to fetch user document and apply custom_limits (supports both new custom_limits dict and legacy custom_max_* fields), 2) Updated get_usage_stats() to check and override plan limits with custom_limits, 3) Added custom_limit_applied flag to indicate when custom limits are in effect, 4) Enhanced to support all limit types (chatbots, messages, file_uploads, website_sources, text_sources). Now when admin sets custom limits via Ultimate Edit modal, those limits immediately take effect and are properly enforced across all APIs (chatbot creation, message sending, source uploads) and correctly displayed on user dashboard."
  - agent: "main"
    message: "✅ SEND NOTIFICATION FIX APPLIED (2025-11-14): Fixed issue where Send Notification from Admin Panel → Users → Actions was not working. ROOT CAUSE: Notification model in models_notifications.py had restricted notification types using Literal, and 'admin_message' type was not in the allowed list causing validation error: 'Input should be new_conversation, high_priority_message, performance_alert, usage_warning, new_user_signup, webhook_event, source_processing, chatbot_down or api_error'. FIX: Added 'admin_message' to the allowed notification types in Notification model. TESTING: Verified notification successfully created in database with all fields (user_id, type, title, message, priority=high, metadata with admin flags, created_at, read=false). Admin can now send notifications to any user from admin panel which will appear in user's notification center."

  - agent: "main"
    message: "✅ PAYMENT GATEWAY TEST MODE IMPLEMENTED (2025-11-14 11:44): Modified payment gateway settings in admin panel to support test mode. Changes: 1) Backend - Added test_mode field to LemonSqueezySettings model (defaults to True), updated TestConnectionRequest to include test_mode parameter, modified test connection response to indicate mode (Test Mode/Live Mode). 2) Frontend - Added test_mode toggle in PaymentGatewaySettings component with blue gradient styling, implemented fetchProducts function for auto-fetching LemonSqueezy products (was missing), added visual Test Mode badge on API key field when in test mode, added prominent yellow warning banner when test mode is active and enabled, updated all API calls (testConnection, fetchProducts) to include test_mode parameter. Features: Toggle between Test Mode (default) and Live Mode, visual indicators showing current mode throughout the UI, clear warnings about test mode preventing real payments, helpful text reminding to switch to live mode before production.

ROOT CAUSE: NotificationCenter component was navigating to /notifications route but this route didn't exist in App.js routing configuration. FIX: 1) Created comprehensive /app/frontend/src/pages/Notifications.jsx page with full notification management features including: view all notifications (paginated, filter by all/unread), mark individual notifications as read, mark all as read with one click, delete individual notifications, bulk select and delete multiple notifications, notification type icons and color coding by priority (high/medium/low) and type (conversation/alert/warning/info), formatted timestamps (relative and absolute), notification metadata display, responsive design matching app theme. 2) Added import for Notifications component in App.js. 3) Added route configuration: <Route path='/notifications' element={<Notifications />} />. 4) Used ResponsiveNav and UserProfileDropdown for consistent navigation. TESTING: Frontend compiled successfully after restart. All services running (backend PID 29, frontend PID 771, mongodb PID 32). User can now click 'View all notifications' from bell icon and access full notifications page without 404 error."
  - agent: "main"
    message: "✅ ADMIN ANALYTICS NaN BUG FIXED (2025-11-16): Fixed critical bug in admin panel Analytics tab showing NaN for New Users (30d), Total Messages (30d), and Avg Messages/Day. ROOT CAUSE: Backend API endpoints (/api/admin/analytics/users/growth and /api/admin/analytics/messages/volume) return data with field name 'count', but frontend component AdvancedAnalytics.jsx was trying to access 'users' and 'messages' fields causing NaN in reduce() calculations. FIX: Updated /app/frontend/src/components/admin/AdvancedAnalytics.jsx: 1) Line 51-52: Changed reduce() to use item.count instead of item.users and item.messages with fallback (item.count || 0), 2) Line 117: Updated conditional check from d.users > 0 to (d.count || 0) > 0, 3) Line 130: Changed chart dataKey from 'users' to 'count', 4) Line 148: Updated conditional check from d.messages > 0 to (d.count || 0) > 0, 5) Line 161: Changed chart dataKey from 'messages' to 'count'. VERIFICATION: Created test script confirming old code produced NaN while new code correctly calculates totals. Backend APIs verified working correctly returning proper data structure. Frontend compiled successfully. Admin analytics now displays correct numerical values instead of NaN for all metrics."
  - agent: "main"
    message: "✅ PROVIDER STATISTICS FULLY FUNCTIONAL (2025-11-16): Verified and fixed Provider Usage Comparison and Provider Statistics features in Admin Analytics. ISSUES FIXED: 1) Inefficient total calculation - moved totalProviders calculation outside map loop (was recalculating for every row), 2) NaN in percentage calculations - added division by zero check (totalProviders > 0 ? calculate : '0.0'), 3) Null provider names - added fallback 'Not Specified' for chatbots without ai_provider field, 4) Missing empty state - added fallback message when no provider data exists, 5) Chart labels showing null - updated pie chart label function and bar chart data transformation to handle null providers. COMPONENTS VERIFIED: ✅ Summary Card showing Active Providers count, ✅ Pie Chart (AI Provider Distribution) with proper labels and tooltips, ✅ Bar Chart (Provider Usage Comparison) with horizontal layout and null handling, ✅ Statistics Table with provider name/count/percentage/status. EDGE CASES HANDLED: Empty data arrays, null/undefined provider names, zero totals, missing count values. TEST DATA: Created 4 test chatbots (2 OpenAI 50%, 1 Claude 25%, 1 Gemini 25%) to verify calculations. API endpoint /api/admin/analytics/providers/distribution verified working correctly. All provider statistics features fully functional with proper error handling and user-friendly displays. Documentation created in PROVIDER_STATISTICS_FIX.md."

        comment: "Implemented complete Slack integration with message handling similar to Telegram. Created SlackService (/app/backend/services/slack_service.py) with methods: send_message (send to channels/DMs with thread support), auth_test (verify bot token), get_user_info (fetch user details), set_webhook (return setup instructions), get_bot_info (bot details). Created Slack router (/app/backend/routers/slack.py) with 6 endpoints: POST /api/slack/webhook/{chatbot_id} (receive Slack events, handle url_verification challenge, process messages with background tasks, ignore bot messages to prevent loops), POST /api/slack/{chatbot_id}/setup-webhook (generate webhook URL and return setup instructions), GET /api/slack/{chatbot_id}/webhook-info (get webhook configuration and instructions), DELETE /api/slack/{chatbot_id}/webhook (remove webhook config), POST /api/slack/{chatbot_id}/send-test-message (test message sending). Message processing: Receives messages from Slack channels/DMs via Events API webhook, generates session_id from channel and user_id, creates/updates conversations in MongoDB, fetches knowledge base context using vector store, generates AI responses using ChatService with multi-provider support (OpenAI/Claude/Gemini), sends responses back to Slack with thread support, updates subscription usage (messages_this_month), logs all integration events. Frontend: Added handleSetupSlackWebhook function that calls setup endpoint and displays instructions, added Slack webhook setup button (green with Zap icon) next to test/delete buttons when Slack integration is configured, webhook URL logged to console with detailed setup steps. Setup process: User adds Slack bot token in UI, clicks webhook setup button (⚡), gets webhook URL and instructions, manually configures Events API in Slack App settings (https://api.slack.com/apps), subscribes to bot events (message.channels, message.im, message.groups), bot receives messages and responds with AI in real-time. All Slack models (SlackWebhookSetup, SlackMessage) added to models.py. Slack router registered in server.py. Pattern follows working Telegram integration exactly."

How can I assist you today?'), 6) ✅ BACKEND API: GET /api/chat/messages/{conversation_id} returns 200 OK with proper message array, 7) ✅ MESSAGE FORMAT: Messages include correct fields (id, role, content, timestamp) and display properly in UI. BACKEND VERIFICATION: Direct API testing confirmed all conversation endpoints working: GET /api/admin/conversations returns 4 conversations with message_count=2, GET /api/chat/messages/{id} returns proper message arrays for all tested conversation IDs. The user-reported issue of 'No messages in this conversation' is NOT occurring - messages are displaying correctly in the modal. The console.log debug statements mentioned in the user request are not present, suggesting the code may have been updated since the issue was reported.

        comment: "✅ CRITICAL BUG FIXED (BACKEND): Resolved duplicate conversation creation issue. ROOT CAUSE: The Conversation model was missing the 'session_id' field, causing the conversation lookup query to fail and create new conversations for every message. FIXES APPLIED: 1) MODELS.PY: Added 'session_id: Optional[str] = None' field to both Conversation and ConversationResponse models to enable session tracking. Added 'messages_count: int = 0' field as alias for message_count for database compatibility. 2) CHAT.PY: Fixed conversation counting logic - added 'is_new_conversation' flag to properly track when conversations are created. Changed 'conversations_count' increment from '1 if not conversation else 0' (which was backwards) to '1 if is_new_conversation else 0'. 3) DATABASE CLEANUP: Deleted duplicate conversations from database and added session_id to existing conversation. TESTING: Verified conversation now has session_id field and query works correctly. The chat endpoint now properly finds existing conversations by session_id instead of creating duplicates. Backend restarted successfully with model changes applied."

FRONTEND FIXES APPLIED: 1) PUBLICCHAT.JSX: Updated sessionId useState to retrieve from localStorage using key 'chatbot_session_{chatbotId}'. If no session exists, creates new one and stores it. Session now persists across page reloads and messages. 2) EMBEDCHAT.JSX: Applied same localStorage persistence logic for embedded chat widget. 3) CHATPAGE.JSX: Applied same localStorage persistence for internal chat page. 4) CHATPREVIEWMODAL.JSX: Applied localStorage persistence for chat preview modal. DATABASE CLEANUP: Deleted duplicate conversation created at 07:01 AM, kept original from 06:51 AM. BACKEND TESTING: Created test script that sends 2 messages with same session_id - verified both messages use SAME conversation ID (71d69310-c5b6-479a-a547-e3e30959f60b) with messages_count correctly showing 4. Frontend restarted to apply changes. IMPACT: Session IDs now persist in browser localStorage per chatbot. Users can continue conversations across page reloads. Multiple messages to same chatbot = single conversation. Admin panel shows accurate conversation counts. Backend test: ✅ PASSED - Same session_id = Same conversation."

Root cause: Telegram webhook message handler (process_telegram_message in telegram.py) was only updating chatbot.messages_count but NOT calling plan_service.increment_usage() to update subscription usage statistics. Fix applied: Added subscription usage tracking to telegram.py line 174-178 - now increments usage by 2 (user + assistant messages) when processing Telegram messages, same as regular chat and public chat endpoints.

    message: "SYSTEM INSTRUCTIONS FEATURE FIX: User reported system instructions in chatbot builder Settings tab were not working. Root cause identified: Frontend was sending 'instructions' field but backend ChatbotUpdate model only accepted 'system_message', and ChatbotResponse didn't return 'instructions' field. Fix applied: 1) Added 'instructions' field to ChatbotUpdate and ChatbotResponse models in models.py, 2) Updated chatbots.py update endpoint to map instructions to both instructions and system_message fields, 3) Added logic in get_chatbots, get_chatbot, and update_chatbot endpoints to ensure instructions field is populated from system_message if not present, 4) Both chat.py and public_chat.py already use instructions field correctly. Testing confirmed: System instructions now save correctly (both instructions and system_message fields updated), retrieve correctly (instructions field populated), and apply correctly (chatbot uses custom instructions in responses). Tested with instruction 'You are a friendly customer support assistant. Always be polite and helpful.' and chatbot correctly responded as customer support assistant."

    message: "CHAT LOGS LOADING FIX: User reported 'failed to load chat logs' error in Analytics tab. Root cause identified: ConversationResponse model had required fields (rating, message_count) but existing conversations in database were missing these fields, causing Pydantic validation errors. Fix applied: 1) Updated ConversationResponse model in models.py to set default values for all optional fields (user_name=None, user_email=None, status='active', rating=None, message_count=0), 2) Updated get_conversations endpoint in chat.py to populate missing fields with defaults before creating response objects. Testing confirmed: GET /api/chat/conversations/{chatbot_id} now returns all conversations successfully with proper field defaults, GET /api/chat/messages/{conversation_id} returns messages correctly. Chat logs now load properly in Analytics tab without validation errors."

    message: "CRITICAL DISCORD INTEGRATION FIX - AI Response Generation Error: User reported Discord bot online but all messages getting error 'I apologize, but I encountered an error processing your message.' Root cause identified from backend logs: 'Error generating AI response: tuple object has no attribute get' at line 191 in discord_bot_manager.py and line 149 in discord.py. The issue: ChatService.generate_response() returns a tuple (response, citation_footer) but Discord code was treating it as a dictionary with .get('response'). Fix applied: 1) Updated discord_bot_manager.py lines 177-201 to properly unpack the tuple: response_tuple = await chat_service.generate_response(...), then response_text, citation_footer = response_tuple, 2) Updated discord.py lines 138-160 with same tuple unpacking fix, 3) Added citation footer appending logic if available. Other integrations (Telegram, Slack, public_chat, regular chat) were already correctly unpacking the tuple. Backend restarted successfully, Discord bot automatically reconnected (Found 1 enabled Discord integrations, bot connected as 'botsmith'). User messages now being received, AI responses being generated via EMERGENT_LLM_KEY with proper response text instead of error messages.

        comment: "❌ CRITICAL ISSUES FOUND - MS TEAMS INTEGRATION NOT FUNCTIONAL: Comprehensive testing revealed 2 critical blocking issues preventing MS Teams integration from working. ✅ CODE IMPLEMENTATION EXISTS: MS Teams router (/app/backend/routers/msteams.py) and service (/app/backend/services/msteams_service.py) are fully implemented with 6 endpoints: POST /api/msteams/webhook/{chatbot_id} (receive Teams messages), POST /api/msteams/{chatbot_id}/setup-webhook (generate webhook URL), GET /api/msteams/{chatbot_id}/webhook-info (get webhook config), DELETE /api/msteams/{chatbot_id}/webhook (remove webhook), POST /api/msteams/{chatbot_id}/send-test-message (test message sending). MSTeamsService includes authentication (OAuth2 token), message sending, credential validation, conversation management. ❌ ISSUE #1 - ROUTER NOT REGISTERED: MS Teams router is imported in server.py line 8 but NEVER registered with api_router. Missing line: api_router.include_router(msteams.router). Result: All MS Teams endpoints return 404 Not Found. ❌ ISSUE #2 - INTEGRATION TYPE NOT ALLOWED: Integration model in models.py line 849 only allows: 'slack', 'telegram', 'discord', 'whatsapp', 'webchat', 'api', 'twilio', 'messenger' but NOT 'msteams'. Result: Cannot create MS Teams integration - returns 422 validation error. ✅ TESTING RESULTS: 19 comprehensive tests executed, 31.6% success rate (6/19 passed). Failed tests: Create integration (422 - type not allowed), test connection (404 - router not registered), setup webhook (404), get webhook info (404), toggle integration (404), delete integration (404). Passed tests: Invalid ID handling, error validation, integration logs API. ✅ INTEGRATION MANAGEMENT APIs WORKING: The general integration management endpoints (GET/POST/DELETE /api/integrations) work correctly for other integration types (Slack, Telegram, Discord tested successfully). MS Teams just needs to be added to allowed types and router registered. REQUIRED FIXES: 1) Add 'msteams' to Integration model's Literal type in models.py line 849, 2) Add 'msteams' to IntegrationCreate model's Literal type in models.py line 862, 3) Register MS Teams router in server.py: api_router.include_router(msteams.router).
